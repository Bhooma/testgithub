If your application has a lot of dynamic content changing within the view, like the gallery of photos on your Instagram feed, React is the clear winner. If you don’t have time to learn React, those JSX files have you feeling uncomfortable, or you want to be ready for the WC3’s latest web standards, it might be easier to quickly setup a sleek and simple website using Polymer

As a progressive framework, Vue allows just using its most fundamental features to build an app, but if needed, it also offers most of everything you need out of the box: Vuex for state management, Vue Router for app URL management, Vue Server-Side Renderer for Server-Side Rendering.




React is a trend-setter and a highly demanded skill in the industry. React is a clear leader today, both in industry-hype and community appreciation. It’s super-popular and, to be honest, it deserves the status very well. React makes it easy to build both complex and straightforward web and mobile applications, but it comes with a price — framework complexity and boilerplate. The basics are relatively intuitive, but large React projects tend to get complicated, and the fragmentation in the community does not help. The fact that React introduced many new paradigms has some negative effect on its learning curve.
Vue is leaner, a straight-forward, and fresh framework that deserves a place on the podium for being super simple to learn, very low on boilerplate code, performant, flexible and complete package. Many web apps today, could have been built faster with Vue than with React. Vue is fun to develop with and is pretty straightforward.

polymer vision - lit element

https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/issues/5240#issuecomment-395922668


Along the way, though, we've ended up creating a body of work that (despite our intentions) is widely perceived as a full-blown framework, comprising the web components polyfills, the Polymer library, the Polymer Elements, the Polymer App Toolbox and the Polymer CLI. People commonly refer to all of the above as "Polymer" and talk about developing "Polymer apps".

This perception is at odds with our vision – we want developers to build web apps, not Polymer apps, and we aim to provide not an all-inclusive framework but a collection of lightweight, loosely coupled products that developers can use to build elements and apps that make the most of the platform


why we need to change our UI ?




* Going forward, the simpler, lighter `LitElement` will become our recommended element base class, available in the standalone `lit-element` library. The `polymer` library is going into maintenance mode – meaning that it will continue to be supported with critical bug fixes and maintenance releases, but won't see active feature development – and will be renamed (most likely to `polymer-classic`) to reflect its status

Awesome read to migrate from polymer to lit


https://43081j.com/2018/08/future-of-polymer

* If coming from Polymer 2, Polymer 3 is something you should upgrade to, as it can be mostly automated through the modulizer
* If starting from new, you should use lit-element
* If you want to go all in, do a full conversion and drink buckets of coffee (like I may have done), go straight to lit-element
