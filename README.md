some people prefer hotter climates, while others prefer colder climates. discuss both views and give your opinion
While some people prefer hotter environment, others would like to live in colder environment. My opinion is that it is better for people to live under the sunny spells rather than suffering in freezing cold.
On the one hand, there are people who hold the opinion that colder climate is better than hotter climate. The most convincing reason for believing this is that hotter climate can produce serious health issues which may cause even death. Heatstroke is the best example of this. In recent years, there is an increasing number of population affected by heatstroke in Asian countries. Another reason is that, most of the westerners have less amount of melanin content in their skin. Due to this fact, their tolerance towards heatwaves and hot temperature is minimal. Therefore, it is easy to see why some people prefer hotter climates. 
Despite the above arguments, I am of the view that clear blue skies are always better than the cold spell. Indeed, one reason why I take this view is that one can wear minimal number of clothes in the hotter climate when compared to the bitterly cold climate. One may not be concerned about carrying of thermals, sweater and winter coats all the time on his body unlike cold climate. A further reason is that unlike colder countries, people may not need to worry about dealing with snow and thick fogs because it is highly difficult for the people living in colder temperatures to deal with the blanket of snow. There are several incidents shown in news where people had tough times clearing snow from vehicles and commuting to office.
In conclusion. while both views are commonly held in society, I believe that living in hotter climates is far more easy compared to living in colder climates. The reason for this is that it reduces the burden of wearing more clothes and dealing with thick fog and snow.

Dear Sir or Madam,
I am Bhooma from Anand International hotel. I am writing to request your service for translating an important document with high priority.
To begin with, I am organising a conference for Chinese clients in my hotel in two days and have been asked to arrange a few things corresponding to that. Unfortunately, the document sent by my clients is in Chinese which I do not understand. 
The document contains seven pages. Out of which, three pages are related to agenda and the remaining four pages have items and materials required for the meeting. It also has some information printed on the back of the document cover.
Finally, understanding this document is very crucial for me to organize the conference which will help me to get some good reviews from my clients. I need to order the items in the document in advance. Also, I need to plan for the food based on the lunch timing mentioned in the agenda. I am thankful, if you can translate and send the document by end of day today.
Appreciate your help.

Yours faithfully,
Bhooma
